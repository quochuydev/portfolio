# **a simple technical solution document**

## **Meta**

*Who's preparing this, who other reviewers/commenters. Build the sense of responsibilities*

## **Overview the purpose, the problem it is solving**

*Give the purpose of changes, initiatives, even better giving the context and the problem is the document trying to change*

*It's also important to be aware of certain constraints, like Timing, Budget, Resources, or Legal, Security etc*

## **Glossary**

*Build the common ground, common languages, coin terms, addresses aliases etc. Make sure you don't speak like an Alien*

## **Proposal**

*Rationale with leading to the changes, like the strategy to solve the problems or introducing changes. Proposal should come from eagle eye to certain level of details to help better understanding on risks, edge scenarios*

## **Weighting / Pros and cons**

*Explain what's within the scope, what's outside of scope*

*Explain pros and cons of other approaches, known issues, and rationale why the proposal is the chosen one*

*This area will give a depth the proposal, we don't just grab the first option out there*

## **Detail design / implementation steps**

*It should have a certain level of details to explain how to progress the proposal further. That'll be the exoskeleton for further discussion because this step will also address constraints, short-comings and few other things.*

*This is normally you'll want to elaborate with diagrams to explain carefully certain edges*
